Code cells permit you to write (and execute!) Python code. They consist of an *Input* section, where you write your code, and an *Output* section, which displays errors and execution results. Markdown cells are for writing **documentation**. This is very important since it helps you to keep your notebook organized, such that you (and others) will understand what you were doing when you conducted a specific analysis.\n",
